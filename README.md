# AUV-2026

This project is currently under development

Ahoy! This project contains software intended to run on the custom-built Douglas AUV to compete at RoboSub2025 on behalf of McGill Robotics.

This project is maintained by the McGill Robotics Club and was developed by its members - students of McGill University.

## Setting Up the Dev Environment

Before setting up the dev environment, you should have the following software installed:
- `Visual Studio Code`
- [`Visual Studio Code Remote Containers Plugin`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- `Docker` (either through `Docker Desktop` or **CLI**)

If you have the software installed, follow these instructions:

1. `git clone` this repository on your local environment.
2. Open the repo in **VS Code**.
3. In the bottom left, you should see a little blue/green box. This will bring up the VSCode dialogue.
  (Keyboard Shortcut: `CTRL + SHIFT + P` or `CMD + SHIFT + P`)

5. Select ***"Remote Containers: Reopen in container"***
6. VS Code will automatically load necessary files and configure the dev environment. This can take minutes to load.

Once loading is complete, your ready to develop!
