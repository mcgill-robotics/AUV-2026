# Propulsion

The **propulsion** package handles low-level actuation for the AUV. It transforms high-level control efforts, expressed as [`geometry_msgs/Wrench`](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/geometry_msgs/msg/Wrench.html), into **PWM signals (µs)** for each thruster.

This process occurs in two stages:

1. **Thrust allocation** – map the wrench vector (forces and torques along X, Y, Z) into individual thruster forces using an allocation matrix.  
2. **Force-to-PWM mapping** – convert thruster forces (in Newtons) into PWM signals (µs) using per-thruster calibration curves.

## Overview
The [wrench](https://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Wrench.html) consists of forces AND torques on the X,Y,Z axes. These are distributed to the thrusters using the following allocation matrix:

</p>


- Parameters a, b, c, d, e, and alpha describe the distances and angular offsets between thrusters and the AUV’s center of gravity.

- The *i-th* column corresponds to the contribution of thruster *i* to each element of the wrench vector.

- The *j-th* row corresponds to how all thrusters contribute to the *j-th* component of the wrench (force or torque along X, Y, Z).

The resulting thruster forces (in Newtons) are converted to PWM microseconds using per-thruster calibration functions. These functions were obtained from a thruster test conducted by the Mech & Elec team in May 2025.

## Usage
The propulsion package is not for direct use, it is used through publishing efforts on the 'effort' topic.

Publishing a `geometry_msgs/Wrench` message onto `/controls/effort` topic:


        ros2 topic pub /controls/effort geometry_msgs/msg/Wrench "{force: {x: 1.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, torque: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}" 1


## Nodes
The package provides a single ROS node: `thrust_mapper`.

- Input: subscribes to `/controls/effort`

- Outputs: publishes thruster forces and PWM microseconds
