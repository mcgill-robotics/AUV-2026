An issue should be detailed and clear enough that anyone on the team can read it and start working on the task.
Ideally, they should never have to ask for clarifications from you.
But be adaptible, if you are writing an issue that you will work on, then it is unnecessary to add too many details. If this is an issue for a new member, please be as detailed and helpful as possible. Let's not be corporate about this lol
