# ROS 2 Docker Container for Jetson Orin Nano

This repository contains a Dockerized ROS 2 Humble development environment for the **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano**, pre-configured with the ZED SDK, CUDA-accelerated OpenCV, and other essential tools. It is designed to provide a consistent, performant, and isolated workspace for our projects. It has been tested with:
*   **Hardware:** NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit.
*   **Host OS:** L4T 36.4.4
*   **ZED SDK:** 5.0.0
  
## üöÄ Quick Start
1.  **Launch the Container:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
2.  **Open a Shell inside the Container:**
    ```bash
    docker exec -it jetson-douglas-1 bash
    ```

## üèóÔ∏è Building from Source 

This container is built upon the excellent [`dustynv/ros:humble-desktop-l4t-r36.4.0`](https://hub.docker.com/layers/dustynv/ros/humble-desktop-l4t-r36.4.0/images/sha256-b8ee30b1ae189cfeeea755a7fd6b8aea74267f5c1bc0cfa4f19a6acec9d941e5) image. The core of our setup is derived from the [ZED ROS2 Wrapper Dockerfile](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros2-wrapper/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile.l4t-humble), which we have extended with our own packages.

To rebuild the container from scratch, you can use the provided helper script from the ZED repository:

```bash
# Example for our setup: L4T 36.4.4 and ZED SDK 5.0.0
# Note: As of Sept 2025, there is not dustynv image for 36.4.4 so we use 36.4.0
./jetson_build_dockerfile_from_sdk_and_l4T_version.sh l4t-r36.4.0 zedsdk-5.0.0
```
Please consult ZED's readme for more info.

**OpenCV issue:**
NVIDIA‚Äôs OpenCV version (4.10) which comes from dustynv's base image and provides CUDA acceleration are not the same as Ubuntu‚Äôs OpenCV version (4.5.4) Any ROS package that depends on vision_opencv (like cv-bridge, image-view) must be built from source against NVIDIA‚Äôs OpenCV. You can check the dependencies by running `apt-get install -s ros-humble-[package name]` inside the clean base container. Problematic packages will have a line like: Conf libopencv-core4.5d (4.5.4+dfsg-9ubuntu4 Ubuntu:22.04/jammy [arm64]).

To address this issue, we are building all packages from source against NVIDIA's OpenCV version.
